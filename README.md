# Media-Framing-of-Protest-Themes-and-Narratives-in-Bangladeshi-Newspaper-Headlines
This is the final project for the Computational Literacy course.
My corpus for the project focuses on newspaper headlines from two major Bangladeshi newspapers covering a recent political disruption in Bangladesh, starting with the Quota Movement and ending with the fall of the regime government.
I wanted to know how the movement was represented in the headlines during the core period.
Research Questions:
i.	What were the most common words or phrases in the headlines?
ii.	How did the tone of headlines change over time?
iii.	How were the protesters described by the headlines?
The file 'Research Description.pdf' contains a detailed explanation of my work and the tools or methods I used.
The 'Main Dataset.xlsx is the raw dataset initially created for the project which includes the headlines along with their dates and newspaper names.
The 'Cleaned Data.txt' is the preprocessed file which has been prepared to analyze with Voyant.
The 'Contexts-KWIC.csv' file conatins the analyzed data about how were the protesters described by the headlines responding to the third reserach question.
All the files and materials I have shared, could be useful to anyone who wants to reproduce the study.
